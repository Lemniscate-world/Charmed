# Sugar Walkthrough 🍬

## Overview
Sugar is a personal AI operating layer that runs locally using Ollama. It provides a chat interface to interact with your knowledge (Obsidian) and tools (Linear).

## Completed Features
### 1. Web Interface (Phase 2)
- **Dashboard**: A modern, dark-themed UI built with React & Tailwind.
- **Chat**: Real-time streaming chat with Markdown support.
- **Model Manager**: Pull and switch Ollama models directly from the UI.
- **Sidebar**: Easy navigation between chats and settings.

### 2. Persistence (Phase 3)
- **SQLite Backend**: Chat history is saved to `sugar_memory.db`.
- **History Management**: View and switch between past conversations.
- **Auto-Titling**: Chats are automatically titled based on content.

### 3. Security & Rules
- **Symlinked Rules**: Shared rules from `kuro-rules` are enforced.
- **Security Scanning**: `bandit` runs on every update.
- **Local-First**: No data leaves your machine unless you configure external tools (Linear).
