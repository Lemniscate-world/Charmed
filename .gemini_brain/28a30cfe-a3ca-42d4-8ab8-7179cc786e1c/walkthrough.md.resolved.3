# Sugar Walkthrough

Sugar is a local AI assistant that helps you manage your digital life.

## New Features (Phase 4)

### 🔌 Connectors & Tools
Sugar can now interact with your apps!
- **Obsidian**: Search your notes (`RAG`) and read note content.
- **Linear**: Create issues directly from chat.
- **Architecture**: The "Brain" now supports **multi-turn streaming**, meaning it can use a tool and then stream the result back to you in real-time.

### 🧠 Intelligent Engine
- **Smart Buffering**: The Engine intercepts tool calls to execute them automatically.
- **Unified API**: All chat requests now flow through the central Engine, ensuring consistent memory and tool access.

## Web Interface (Phase 1-3)
- **Setup Wizard**: Guides you through configuring LLMs and keys.
- **Persistence**: Chats are saved to a local SQLite database.
- **Model Management**: Validates and pulls Ollama models automatically.

## How to Test
1. **Obsidian**: "Search my notes for 'Project X'"
2. **Linear**: "Create a bug report for the login crash"
3. **Chat**: Just talk! The persistence layer remembers your context.
