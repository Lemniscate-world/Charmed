# Walkthrough — Charmed MVP & Universal Rules Integration

I have completed the aggressive cleanup of the "Charmed" codebase and integrated the new universal standards into the master `kuro-rules` repository, syncing them across the project.

## 🚀 Charmed MVP: Lean & Stable
- **Local Fallback Alarm**: Implemented `QMediaPlayer` fallback in [alarm.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py) to ensure reliability when Spotify fails.
- **Aggressive Pruning**: Excised over **1,500 lines of dead code** (History, Templates, Cloud Sync) from [gui.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/gui.py) and [alarm.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py).
- **Zero-Dead-Code**: Surgically removed all residual dialogs and managers.

## 🧠 Universal Rule Integration (kuro-rules)
Integrated the new technical and pedagogical mandates into the master repository and synced them to `Alarmify`:
- **Advanced Testing**: Mandated **CodeQL, SonarQube, Codacy, AFL (Fuzzing), Locust (Load tests)**, and **Stryker (Mutation testing)**.
- **Architectural Excellence**: Introduced the **Reversibility Principle** and code complexity indexing/profiling.
- **Security Hardening**: Established **Policy as Code** and created the mandatory [security.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/security.md).
- **Pedagogical Protocol**: Added **Understandable Comments** requirement to explain the "why" behind non-obvious code.

## 📜 Traceability
- **Cumulative Summaries**: Updated [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/SESSION_SUMMARY.md) in both `kuro-rules` and `Alarmify` to maintain a permanent, cumulative log of all development.
- **Security Governance**: Initialized [security.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/security.md) in `Alarmify` to align with the new universal security policies.

The ecosystem is now synchronized with these high-level standards, and the Charmed project is in a pristine "one feature" state for its pre-MVP release.
