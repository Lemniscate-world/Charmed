# Walkthrough: Rebranding to Charmed 🪄

We have successfully rebranded the repository from **Alarmify/CharmAlarm** to **Charmed**. This was a multi-stage process ensuring consistency across documentation, metadata, build scripts, and the mobile/GUI application layers.

## ✨ Rebranding Highlights

The project has been unified under the **Charmed** brand. This included a global, case-insensitive replacement of legacy branding and update of all persistence paths.

| Category | Legacy Name | New Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Name** | Alarmify / CharmAlarm | **Charmed** |
| **Config Directory** | `~/.alarmify` | `~/.charmed` |
| **Executable** | `Alarmify.exe` | `Charmed.exe` |
| **Primary Spec** | `alarmify.spec` | [charmed.spec](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/charmed.spec) |

### Key Files Updated
- [README.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/README.md)
- [main.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/main.py) (App name, Org name)
- [gui.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/gui.py) (Window titles, UI labels)
- [alarm.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py) (Persistence paths)
- [installer.iss](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/installer.iss) (Installer metadata)

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

As part of the rule enforcement, we identified and fixed a high-severity security vulnerability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MD5 to SHA256 Migration**: Replaced the weak MD5 checksum in [cloud_sync_api.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/cloud_sync/cloud_sync_api.py) with SHA256 to ensure data integrity and meet modern security standards.

## 🧪 Verification & Stability

We refactored the [Alarm](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py) class to improve testability and addressed multiple regressions in the GUI and Thread Safety test suites caused by strict mock validation and branding mismatches.

### Test Proof (100% PASS)
All 425+ tests were executed and are now Passing.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Launch Verification**: Run [main.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/main.py) to experience the new "Charmed" branding in the UI.
2. **Binary Generation**: Run [build_installer.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/build_installer.py) to generate the new rebranded installer using the updated [charmed.spec](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/charmed.spec).
