# Implementation Plan: Rule Refinement, Cleanup, and MVP Planning

This plan addresses the user's feedback regarding destructive [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/SESSION_SUMMARY.md) updates and the need to streamline the repository for a "pre-MVP" state.

## Proposed Changes

### Rule Refinement
Update core rules to ensure that [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/SESSION_SUMMARY.md) is always appended to, never overwritten.

#### [MODIFY] [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/.cursorrules)
Add a "STRICT ENFORCEMENT" note to the cumulative updates section.

#### [MODIFY] [AI_GUIDELINES.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/AI_GUIDELINES.md)
Reinforce the cumulative update protocol with a warning against overwriting.

### Repository Cleanup
Remove all non-essential and temporary files to reach a clean "pre-MVP" state.

#### [DELETE] Temporary Logs
- `final_test_results*.txt`
- `test_output*.txt`
- [final_test_results_v3.txt](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/final_test_results_v3.txt)

#### [DELETE] Non-Essential Documentation/Placeholders
- Identifying which of the 20+ [.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/BUILD.md) files are redundant or purely architectural notes that don't belong in a lean MVP repo.
- Potential removal of `mobile_app/` if it's considered out of scope for the initial desktop MVP.

### MVP Feature Proposal: **Local Fallback Alarm** 🛡️
The current feature is "Spotify Alarm". However, an alarm clock that depends on the internet (Spotify) is not 100% reliable for an MVP.

**Proposed Feature**: If Spotify playback fails or the internet is down, the app should fall back to a local MP3/WAV alarm sound.
- **Why**: Essential for a reliable MVP alarm clock.
- **Complexity**: Low (simple file playback adapter).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `pytest` after cleanup to ensure no essential files were deleted.

### Manual Verification
- Verify [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/SESSION_SUMMARY.md) now contains the full history of this session added to the previous ones.
- Check file system for cleanliness.
