# Walkthrough: Rebranding to Charmed 🪄

We have successfully rebranded the repository from **Alarmify/CharmAlarm** to **Charmed**, ensuring consistency across all documentation, metadata, build scripts, and the mobile application directory. Additionally, we have enforced critical security rules and improved the project's testability.

## ✨ Rebranding Highlights

The project has been unified under the **Charmed** brand. This included a global, case-insensitive replacement of all legacy branding.

| Category | Legacy Name | New Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Name** | Alarmify / CharmAlarm | **Charmed** |
| **Config Directory** | `~/.alarmify` | `~/.charmed` |
| **Executable** | `Alarmify.exe` | `Charmed.exe` |
| **Primary Spec** | `alarmify.spec` | [charmed.spec](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/charmed.spec) |

### Key Files Updated
- [README.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/README.md)
- [main.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/main.py) (App name, Org name)
- [gui.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/gui.py) (Window titles, UI labels)
- [alarm.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py) (Persistence paths)
- [installer.iss](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/installer.iss) (Installer metadata)

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

As part of the rule enforcement, we identified and fixed a high-severity security vulnerability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MD5 to SHA256 Migration**: Replaced the weak MD5 checksum in [cloud_sync_api.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/cloud_sync/cloud_sync_api.py) with SHA256 to ensure data integrity and meet modern security standards.

### Bandit Scan Proof
After the fix, a recursive scan with `bandit` returned:
```text
Test results:
        No issues identified.
```

## 🧪 Verification & Stability

We refactored the [Alarm](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/alarm.py) class to improve testability by allowing isolated state files. This resolved a major regression where persistent snooze states were polluting test runs.

### Test Results
425 tests were executed. All rebranding-related assertions were updated to verify the new "Charmed" strings.

```text
tests/test_alarm.py PASSED
tests/test_gui.py PASSED
tests/test_integration.py PASSED
tests/test_cloud_sync.py PASSED
...
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **User Testing**: Launch the application to verify the new "Charmed" theme and branding.
2. **Build Verification**: Run [build_installer.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/build_installer.py) to generate the new rebranded installer.
