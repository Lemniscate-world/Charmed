# Walkthrough: Rule Update and Repository Cleanup

I have updated the project rules to ensure seamless continuity when switching between different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) and performed essential repository maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hardened Universal Rules & Protocol
- **Modular Design (Hub & Spokes)**: Standardized methodology across repositories.
- **Devil's Advocate Protocol**: Critical thinking framework active.
- **Security Hardening**: Explicit mandates for secrets and validation.

### 2. Multi-lingual & Cumulative Traceability
- **Cumulative Summaries**: A new mandate ensures that [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Aladin/SESSION_SUMMARY.md) preserves the entire history of the project, facilitating seamless editor transitions without losing context.
- **Bilingual Support**: All summaries now feature both French and English versions.
- **Auto-Commit**: Atomic commits are performed after every significant task completion.

### 3. Project Aladin: Probabilistic Transformer
We have officially entered the implementation phase (Phase 2):
- **Step 1: Synthetic Generator**: [synthetic_gen.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Aladin/src/synthetic_gen.py) creates noisy sine waves for ground truth validation.
- **Step 2: TimeSeriesDataset**: [dataset.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Aladin/src/dataset.py) handles the sliding window logic for sequences.
- **Step 3: Positional Encoding**: [positional_encoding.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Aladin/src/positional_encoding.py) provides temporal signatures to the Transformer.

### 4. Educational Sessions
- **Concepts Covered**: Normal Distribution (3D Visualization), ChatGPT Architecture, Attention Mechanics (Query, Key, Value).

## Verification Results
- [x] `kuro-rules`, `NeuralDBG`, and `Aladin` repositories committed and synchronized.
- [x] Cumulative rules active in all master guidelines.
- [x] 3D visualizations for pedagogical support generated.

## Next Steps
We will proceed to the core of the Transformer model:
1.  **Step 4**: Transformer Encoder Core implementation.
2.  **Briefing 3**: Probabilistic Head & Gaussian Distribution mechanics.






### 2. Repository Cleanup
The redundant `SpyderTerminal` directory has been removed to keep the workspace organized. Only `Aladin` is now used for Project A.

## Verification Results

### Rule Synchronization
- [x] `kuro-rules` updated with new summary template.
- [x] `NeuralDBG` synchronized with master rules.
- [x] `Aladin` initialized and synchronized with master rules.

### Cleanup
- [x] `SpyderTerminal` folder deleted successfully.
- [x] `Aladin` survives as the primary repository for the Probabilistic Transformer.

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`, using `NeuralDBG` as our iterative debugging partner.
