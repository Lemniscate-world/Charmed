# Walkthrough: Rule Update and Repository Cleanup

I have updated the project rules to ensure seamless continuity when switching between different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) and performed essential repository maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cross-Editor Continuity Rules
I've enhanced the **Session Summary** template across all project rule files. This ensures that every time a session ends, the AI assistant leaves a clear trail of its work and its vision, regardless of which editor is used next.

**Updated Template includes:**
- **Editor**: Specifically identify which tool was used (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.).
- **Initiatives given**: Strategic directions or new ideas born during the session.

Files updated:
- [AI_GUIDELINES.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/kuro-rules/AI_GUIDELINES.md) (Master)
- [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/kuro-rules/.cursorrules) (Master & Project)
- [NeuralDBG/.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/NeuralDBG/.cursorrules)
- [Aladin/.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Aladin/.cursorrules) (New sync)

### 2. Repository Cleanup
The redundant `SpyderTerminal` directory has been removed to keep the workspace organized. Only `Aladin` is now used for Project A.

## Verification Results

### Rule Synchronization
- [x] `kuro-rules` updated with new summary template.
- [x] `NeuralDBG` synchronized with master rules.
- [x] `Aladin` initialized and synchronized with master rules.

### Cleanup
- [x] `SpyderTerminal` folder deleted successfully.
- [x] `Aladin` survives as the primary repository for the Probabilistic Transformer.

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`, using `NeuralDBG` as our iterative debugging partner.
