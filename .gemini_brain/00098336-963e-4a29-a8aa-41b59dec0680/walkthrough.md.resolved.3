# Walkthrough: Rule Update and Repository Cleanup

I have updated the project rules to ensure seamless continuity when switching between different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) and performed essential repository maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hardened Universal Rules (Sugar Wisdom)
I've extracted the most effective architectural and behavioral protocols from the **Sugar** project and made them universal constants for all our work:

- **Modular Design (Hub & Spokes)**: A mandate to keep the core logic pure and use adapters for external tools. This makes every project we build resilient and extensible.
- **Devil's Advocate Protocol**: A structured checklist that I must follow before, during, and after implementation to ensure we are building the right thing, the right way.
- **Security Hardening**: Explicit "Always/Never" mandates for secrets, input validation, and unauthorized file access.

### 2. Pedagogical Execution
- **10-Step Decomposition**: Every complex task is now broken down into granular, understandable steps.
- **Concept First**: No "magic code". I must explain the theory and math (Transformer, Gaussian models, etc.) before writing a single line.
- **Reference Library**: Integrated a suggested reading list (Kevin Murphy, etc.) directly into the project guidelines.

### 3. Traceability
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Mandatory, standardized session recording across all repositories.




### 2. Repository Cleanup
The redundant `SpyderTerminal` directory has been removed to keep the workspace organized. Only `Aladin` is now used for Project A.

## Verification Results

### Rule Synchronization
- [x] `kuro-rules` updated with new summary template.
- [x] `NeuralDBG` synchronized with master rules.
- [x] `Aladin` initialized and synchronized with master rules.

### Cleanup
- [x] `SpyderTerminal` folder deleted successfully.
- [x] `Aladin` survives as the primary repository for the Probabilistic Transformer.

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`, using `NeuralDBG` as our iterative debugging partner.
