# Walkthrough: Rule Update and Repository Cleanup

I have updated the project rules to ensure seamless continuity when switching between different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) and performed essential repository maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Pedagogical & Universal Rules
I've refactored the project rules to be completely **universal** and **deeply educational**. 

**New Pedagogical Protocol (MANDATORY):**
- **10-Step Decomposition**: Every complex task must be broken down into granular steps.
- **Concept First**: Every implementation (Transformer, Gaussian, etc.) must be explained conceptually before code is written.
- **Learning Sources**: Integrated a **Suggested Reading** list featuring key books to help you learn as we build.

**Updated Files:**
- [AI_GUIDELINES.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/kuro-rules/AI_GUIDELINES.md) (Now featuring the pedagogical mandate and reading list)
- [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/kuro-rules/.cursorrules) (Refactored to be project-agnostic)

### 2. Physical Traceability
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Mandatory requirement across all projects to ensure continuity across different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.).



### 2. Repository Cleanup
The redundant `SpyderTerminal` directory has been removed to keep the workspace organized. Only `Aladin` is now used for Project A.

## Verification Results

### Rule Synchronization
- [x] `kuro-rules` updated with new summary template.
- [x] `NeuralDBG` synchronized with master rules.
- [x] `Aladin` initialized and synchronized with master rules.

### Cleanup
- [x] `SpyderTerminal` folder deleted successfully.
- [x] `Aladin` survives as the primary repository for the Probabilistic Transformer.

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`, using `NeuralDBG` as our iterative debugging partner.
