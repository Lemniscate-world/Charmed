# Project Aladin: Probabilistic Transformer Implementation

This plan follows the **Pedagogical Protocol**. We will build a Transformer-based model to predict time series distributions.

## Proposed Steps

### Phase 1: Conceptual Briefings
We will cover the "Why" and "How" of:
1. **Synthetic Data**: Why it's the only way to verify uncertainty.
2. **Transformers**: Why Attention is better than RNNs for long-term dependencies.
3. **Gaussian Heads**: How to output a distribution instead of a point.
4. **NLL Loss**: The math of maximum likelihood estimation.

### Phase 2: Implementation (The 12 Steps)
(See [task.md](file:///home/kuro/.gemini/antigravity/brain/771eaffe-601b-4127-8253-17b40bce0a23/task.md) for the full granular list).

## Verification Plan
1. **Gaussian Test**: Verify that the model can recover the known noise level of synthetic data.
2. **Visual Check**: Plot predicted mean ± standard deviation.
3. **NeuralDBG**: Monitor for exploding gradients in the LogVar output.




### [Component] Cleanup

#### [DELETE] [SpyderTerminal](file:///home/kuro/Documents/SpyderTerminal)
- Remove the redundant repository clone.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A for rule updates and file deletion.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Rule Check**: Verify that `kuro-rules`, `NeuralDBG`, and `Aladin` all contain the updated `Session Summary` template.
2.  **Cleanup Check**: Run `ls /home/kuro/Documents` to confirm `SpyderTerminal` is gone.
3.  **Final Summary**: Demonstrate the new summary format at the end of this session.
