# Walkthrough: Rule Update and Repository Cleanup

I have updated the project rules to ensure seamless continuity when switching between different AI editors (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) and performed essential repository maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hardened Universal Rules (Sugar Wisdom)
I've extracted the most effective architectural and behavioral protocols from the **Sugar** project and made them universal constants for all our work:

- **Modular Design (Hub & Spokes)**: A mandate to keep the core logic pure and use adapters for external tools.
- **Devil's Advocate Protocol**: A structured checklist to ensure we build the right things.
- **Security Hardening**: Explicit "Always/Never" mandates for secrets and input validation.

### 2. Multi-lingual Traceability & Auto-Sync
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Now mandates **both French and English** versions to ensure full accessibility.
- **Auto-Commit Rule**: I now automatically commit changes and update the summary after every significant task.
- **Formula Clarity**: Avoidance of LaTeX `$` notation to ensure math is readable for everyone.

### 3. Pedagogical Visualization: Distributions
To help visualize our current hypothesis (Gaussian Modeling), I've generated a 3D comparison of probability distributions.

- **Normal (Gaussian)**: Smooth bell shape, models data clustered around a mean.
- **Uniform**: Equal probability everywhere, no preference.
- **Laplace**: Sharper peak, models "fat tails" (rare extreme events).

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`.





### 2. Repository Cleanup
The redundant `SpyderTerminal` directory has been removed to keep the workspace organized. Only `Aladin` is now used for Project A.

## Verification Results

### Rule Synchronization
- [x] `kuro-rules` updated with new summary template.
- [x] `NeuralDBG` synchronized with master rules.
- [x] `Aladin` initialized and synchronized with master rules.

### Cleanup
- [x] `SpyderTerminal` folder deleted successfully.
- [x] `Aladin` survives as the primary repository for the Probabilistic Transformer.

## Next Steps
We are now ready to dive into the implementation of the **Probabilistic Transformer** in `Aladin`, using `NeuralDBG` as our iterative debugging partner.
