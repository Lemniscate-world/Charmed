# Fix Blocked Git Push (Secret Scanning)

- [x] Diagnose push failure — confirmed it's GitHub secret scanning, not branch divergence
- [x] Identify offending commit (`ff1679d`) and file (`docs/client_secret_...json`)
- [x] Confirm `git pull --rebase` is clean — no remote changes to integrate
- [ ] **Choose resolution**: rewrite history (Option A) or whitelist secrets (Option B)
- [ ] Execute chosen resolution
- [ ] Successfully push to `origin/main`
- [ ] Ensure credential file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Rotate Google OAuth credentials if they were exposed
