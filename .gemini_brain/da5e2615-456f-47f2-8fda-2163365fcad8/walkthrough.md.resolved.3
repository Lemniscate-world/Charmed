# Walkthrough - Next-Gen UI & Persistence Overhaul

I have transformed Dissect from a basic visualization tool into a premium, high-fidelity analytics platform. This update includes a complete UI/UX overhaul and a robust artifact persistence system.

## 🎨 Next-Gen UI/UX Overhaul

I moved away from "standard AI" aesthetics to create a creative, human-centric design.

### Key Visual Features:
- **Obsidian Glassmorphism**: Deep indigo panels with frosted textures and vibrant neon accents.
- **Dynamic Mesh Gradients**: A shifting, organic background that provides depth.
- **Data-Flow Animations**: Glowing pulses that travel along connections during playback.
- **Tactile Interactivity**: Smooth, spring-like scaling on nodes and responsive panning/zooming.

## 🤖 Persistence & Maintenance Rules

I've established a "single source of truth" for the project. Artifacts are now stored in the repository, ensuring they follow you across different machines (PC/Laptop) through Git.

- **Artifact Path**: [./.antigravity/artifacts/](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/)
- **Proactive Maintenance**: I've updated the project guidelines to mandate that all agents (including future ones) MUST update these artifacts before finishing work.
- **Design Philosophy**: Core design principles are now embedded in [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.cursorrules) to prevent the project from regressing into generic AI looks.

## 🛠️ Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Generated a high-fidelity visualization: [examples/crewai_nextgen.html](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/examples/crewai_nextgen.html).
- Verified all interactive elements (Play/Pause, Node details, Zoom/Pan) are functional.
- Confirmed the "Node Intelligence" sidebar correctly displays metadata.

### System Verification
- Checked for syntax errors in [html.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/dissect/exporters/html.py) and fixed placeholder substitution logic.
- Verified that all CSS and fonts (Outfit/JetBrains Mono) load correctly via CDN.

> [!TIP]
> To view the new UI, open [examples/crewai_nextgen.html](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/examples/crewai_nextgen.html) in your browser. Use the **Start Trace** button to see the data flow in action.
