# Walkthrough: Artifact Persistence Across Editors

I have established a system to ensure that Antigravity's artifacts (tasks, plans, walkthroughs) are accessible to other AI agents and editors like Cursor and VS Code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository-Based Artifact Storage
Instead of relying on local symlinks, I moved the artifacts directly into the repository at [.antigravity/artifacts/](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/). This directory contains the latest versions of:
- [implementation_plan.md](file:///home/kuro/.gemini/antigravity/brain/da5e2615-456f-47f2-8fda-2163365fcad8/implementation_plan.md)
- [task.md](file:///home/kuro/.gemini/antigravity/brain/da5e2615-456f-47f2-8fda-2163365fcad8/task.md)
- [walkthrough.md](file:///home/kuro/.gemini/antigravity/brain/da5e2615-456f-47f2-8fda-2163365fcad8/walkthrough.md)

### 2. Project Rule Updates
I updated [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.cursorrules) to use relative paths. This ensures that any machine running the repo (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) will look for these files in the correct place.

```markdown
## 🤖 Antigravity Integration
- **Context Preservation**: Always check `./.antigravity/artifacts/` for:
    - `implementation_plan.md`: The active roadmap.
    - `task.md`: Current progress.
    - `walkthrough.md`: Verification results.
- **Git Persistence**: Commit these artifacts to track progress across machines.
```

### 3. Updated Persistence Workflow
The workflow in [.agent/workflows/persistence.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.agent/workflows/persistence.md) now focuses on committing artifacts to Git to maintain context across different desktops or laptop environments.

## Verification Results

I verified the setup by confirming the files are correctly placed in the workspace:

```bash
$ ls -R .antigravity/artifacts/
implementation_plan.md  task.md  walkthrough.md
```

The system is now fully cross-machine compatible. Just remember to **commit and push** the `.antigravity/artifacts/` folder when you switch machines!


The system is now fully operational, and you can continue coding with these artifacts in any editor.
