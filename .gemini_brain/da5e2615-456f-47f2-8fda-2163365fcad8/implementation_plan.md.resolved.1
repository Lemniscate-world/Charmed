# Artifact Persistence and Cross-Editor Compatibility

This plan establishes a system to make Antigravity's artifacts (plans, tasks, walkthroughs) available to other editors like Cursor, VS Code, or other AI agents working on this codebase.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component] Repository-Based Artifact Storage

To ensure persistence across different machines (PC/Desktop), the artifacts will be stored directly in the repository. This allows them to be committed to Git and shared.

#### [NEW] [.antigravity/artifacts/](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/)
Create a dedicated folder in the workspace to store the actual markdown artifacts.

#### [COPY] [task.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/task.md)
#### [COPY] [implementation_plan.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/implementation_plan.md)
#### [COPY] [walkthrough.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/artifacts/walkthrough.md)

### [Component] AI Agent Rules

#### [MODIFY] [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.cursorrules)
Update the integration rules to use relative paths within the project, ensuring they work on any machine where the repo is cloned.

```markdown
## 🤖 Antigravity Integration
- **Context Preservation**: Always check `./.antigravity/artifacts/` for:
    - `implementation_plan.md`: The active roadmap.
    - `task.md`: Current progress.
    - `walkthrough.md`: Verification results.
- **Git Persistence**: Commit these artifacts to track progress across machines.
```

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Verify file existence: `ls .antigravity/artifacts/task.md`.
- Verify relative path access in [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.cursorrules).

### Manual Verification
- Commit the `.antigravity/artifacts/` folder and push to Git.
- Clone on another machine and verify Cursor/Agents can see the artifacts.
