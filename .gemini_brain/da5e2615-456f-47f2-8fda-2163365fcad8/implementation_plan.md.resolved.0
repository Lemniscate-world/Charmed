# Artifact Persistence and Cross-Editor Compatibility

This plan establishes a system to make Antigravity's artifacts (plans, tasks, walkthroughs) available to other editors like Cursor, VS Code, or other AI agents working on this codebase.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component] Artifact Linking

#### [NEW] [.antigravity/](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/)
Create a directory in the workspace to hold links to Antigravity's internal storage.

#### [NEW] [.antigravity/current](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.antigravity/current)
A symbolic link pointing to the current conversation's brain directory:
`/home/kuro/.gemini/antigravity/brain/da5e2615-456f-47f2-8fda-2163365fcad8`

### [Component] AI Agent Rules

#### [MODIFY] [.cursorrules](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.cursorrules)
Add a section instructing AI agents to prioritize Antigravity's artifacts.

```markdown
## 🤖 Antigravity Integration
- **Context Preservation**: Always check `.antigravity/current/` for:
    - `implementation_plan.md`: The active roadmap and architectural decisions.
    - `task.md`: Current progress and remaining checklist.
    - `walkthrough.md`: Details of completed work and verification results.
- **Priority**: Antigravity's artifacts are the source of truth for current development tasks.
```

### [Component] Automation

#### [NEW] [persistence.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Dissect/.agent/workflows/persistence.md)
A workflow to automate the linking process.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `ls -ld .antigravity/current` to verify it points to the correct brain directory.
- Verify content accessibility: `cat .antigravity/current/task.md`.

### Manual Verification
- Open the project in Cursor and ask: "What is the current status according to the Antigravity task list?" to confirm Cursor can see the linked files.
