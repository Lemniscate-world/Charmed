## Funding Strategy

### Option A: Bootstrap
- ✅ Keep 100% equity
- ✅ No pressure from investors
- ❌ Slower growth
- 💡 Best if: You have runway / side income

### Option B: Pre-Seed ($200K-500K)
- ✅ Hire faster
- ❌ Give up 10-20% equity
- 💡 Best if: Market window is closing

### Recommendation
**Bootstrap for 6 months → Validate → Then consider funding**

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Public launch | Month 1 | 100 GitHub stars |
| 1K stars | Month 3 | Community validation |
| First paying customer | Month 5 | Revenue starts |
| $1K MRR | Month 8 | Product-market fit signal |
| $10K MRR | Month 18 | Ready for seed round (optional) |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| LangSmith adds multi-framework | Focus on design + open-source community |
| Frameworks become obsolete | Stay framework-agnostic (OpenTelemetry) |
| No adoption | Validate with users before building more |
| Solo founder burnout | Set sustainable pace, consider co-founder |

---

## Decision: Public vs Private Repo?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep Public** | Community, trust, contributions | Competitors can copy |
| **Go Private** | Protect IP | No community, less trust |

**Recommendation**: **Keep Public**. Your strategy is open-core. The value is in execution + community, not in hiding code. LangSmith being proprietary is a *weakness* you exploit by being open.
