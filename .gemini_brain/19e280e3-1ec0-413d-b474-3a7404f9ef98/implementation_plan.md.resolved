# Rebranding and Differentiation Strategy

The goal is to move away from the "Alarmify" name to avoid collision with the existing `alarmify.com` and to emphasize the "95%" of the original idea that is yet to be fully marketed: the desktop ecosystem and seamless cloud synchronization.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Rebranding (The "Charm" Pivot)
Given the deep integration of the "Charm" design system, I propose rebranding to **CharmAlarm** or **Charmify** (pending availability). This aligns with the existing code patterns (e.g., [charm_stylesheet.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/charm_stylesheet.py), [charm_animations.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/charm_animations.py)).

#### [MODIFY] [README.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/README.md)
- Update title and descriptions to the new brand name.
- Emphasize the "Ecosystem" (Desktop + Mobile + Cloud) as the primary differentiator.

#### [MODIFY] [gui.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/gui.py)
- Update window titles and UI text.
- Update logo/icon references if necessary (the [icon_generator.py](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/icon_generator.py) can be updated to generate a new brand-aligned icon).

#### [MODIFY] [mobile_app/README.md](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Alarmify/mobile_app/README.md)
- Update branding in the mobile app documentation.

### 2. Doubling Down on Differentiators
The competitor only has an iOS app. Our "95%" includes:
- **True Cross-Platform Sync**: Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android.
- **Advanced Desktop Utility**: System tray, global shortcuts, and desktop-specific features like "Auto-wake Spotify device".
- **Sophisticated Design**: The "Charm" aesthetic is more distinctive than generic mobile glassmorphism.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions after name changes:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/ -v
  ```

### Manual Verification
- Check the generated icon with the new branding.
- Verify the main window title and all UI labels reflect the new name.
- Verify the mobile app build still works with updated local assets.
