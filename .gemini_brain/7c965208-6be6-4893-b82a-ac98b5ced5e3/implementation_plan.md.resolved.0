# Implementation Plan: Finalizing Charmed

This plan outlines the steps to address security, CI/CD, cross-platform testing, and UI review.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The isolated Python environment prevents `pip install bandit`. I need your permission to install `bandit` system-wide via `sudo apt install python3-bandit` or `pipx install bandit` so we can run the security scan. Which method do you prefer?
> 
> Also, regarding **SonarQube**: Do you have a SonarCloud account for this project, or do you want to set up a local SonarQube container? I will prepare the GitHub Actions workflows accordingly.
>
> Finally, regarding testing the **Windows** version: The project has a [installer.iss](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Charmed/installer.iss) (Inno Setup) and [charmed.spec](file:///home/kuro/Documents/Charmed/charmed.spec) (PyInstaller). Does your team usually build the executable on their Windows machines, or do you want me to write a GitHub Actions workflow to build the `.exe` automatically for them?

## Proposed Changes

### CI/CD Workflows
We will add standard security and quality pipelines.

#### [NEW] .github/workflows/codeql.yml
Will contain standard CodeQL analysis for Python.

#### [NEW] .github/workflows/sonarqube.yml
Will contain standard SonarSource analysis (pending clarification on SonarCloud vs Local).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `bandit -r .` and confirm `0` high/medium severity issues.
- Assure `pytest` still passes 100% after security fixes are applied.

### Manual Verification
1. **Linux Run**: I will run `python main.py` on your Linux environment (via my background tools) to verify it launches without crashing and takes screenshots of the UI.
2. **UI Review**: I will analyze the screenshot against the Charm aesthetics (vibrant colors, modern typography, glassmorphism) and provide feedback.
3. **Windows Test**: We will generate the Windows build instructions or automated asset for your team to test on their machines.
